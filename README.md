Programming Language and Version<br>
Java 17<br>
<br>
Why Java?<br>
Java is a versatile, widely-used programming language known for its platform independence, strong community support, and extensive libraries. I chose Java because of its robust features for object-oriented programming, extensive standard library, and widespread adoption across various domains, including web development, mobile apps, and enterprise applications.<br>
<br>
How Java Handles Key Concepts<br>
Object-Oriented Programming: Java fully supports object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to define classes, create objects, and implement inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.<br>
File Ingestion: Java provides classes like FileReader and BufferedReader for reading files. Libraries like OpenCSV make parsing CSV files easier.<br>
Conditional Statements: Java supports conditional statements like if, else if, and switch.<br>
Assignment Statements: Java uses the = operator for assignment statements.<br>
Loops: Java supports loops including for, while, and do-while.<br>
Subprograms (Functions/Methods): Java uses methods for defining reusable blocks of code. Methods can have parameters and return values.<br>
Unit Testing: Java has built-in support for unit testing through libraries like JUnit and TestNG.<br>
Exception Handling: Java provides try-catch blocks for handling exceptions.<br>
Libraries Used<br>
OpenCSV: OpenCSV is a popular library for reading and writing CSV files in Java. I chose it for its simplicity and flexibility in parsing CSV data.<br>
JUnit: JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java. It provides annotations and assertions to simplify the testing process.<br>
Apache Commons CSV: Apache Commons CSV is another library for handling CSV files in Java. It offers more advanced features like custom separators and quoting strategies.<br>
